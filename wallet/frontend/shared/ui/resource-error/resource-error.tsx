// What a screen shows when a read it needed never arrived.
//
// Ten views each derived a read's failure — most as `data ? null : (read.error?.message ??
// null)`, some with an action error folded in first — and then hand-rolled the banner for
// it. Nothing kept those banners in step, so the same event was reported in three different
// looks depending on which screen you were on, and a fix to one never reached the others.
// Deriving the message stays with the caller; only the looks are stated once, here.
//
// Two forms, because the console and the investor screens report a failure at different
// weights and both are deliberate:
//
//   `inline` — one destructive line under the page header. The admin console's screens are
//              dense grids of figures; a bordered block above them pushes the whole page
//              down for a message that is usually one clause long.
//   `alert`  — uikit's `Alert`, with a heading. The investor screens address the reader
//              ("Couldn't load your positions"), so the message needs a subject and the
//              block gives it one.
//
// `onRetry` boxes the inline form. A button cannot sit in a bare line of text without the
// two reading as unrelated things that happen to be adjacent, so the row and the button
// get a border around them and become one block.
//
// It renders its own `StaggerItem` for the same reason `AdminHeader` does: this is a
// section of the page, it arrives with the rest of them, and a caller that had to remember
// to wrap it would be a caller that could forget. Nothing is wrapped in a new element —
// the inline form animates the `<p>` itself (see `shared/ui/motion`, where the rule and
// the layout it protects are spelled out).
//
// One page-level banner is deliberately not on this: wallet Activity reports its failure
// as bare text with no icon. That is a difference in what is drawn, not in how it is
// built, so aligning it is a UI decision rather than something to smuggle in here.

// What is being reported, in one of two shapes, and the union is the point of the
// distinction rather than a convenience:
//
//   `error`   — the thrown failure itself. Preferred. An error's wording was fixed in
//               English down in the fetch layer, where no translator exists; the key it
//               carries can still be resolved here, at paint time, in the reader's
//               language. This is the render boundary `api-client.ts` names, and passing
//               the error rather than a string is what lets it do its job.
//   `message` — copy the caller composed itself. For the failures that are not a thrown
//               request: a form that rejected its own input, a sentence with a value
//               interpolated into it. Already translated by whoever built it.
//
// Passing `error.message` as `message` type-checks and is exactly the mistake this split
// exists to make visible: it pins the banner to English forever.
//
// Note what the ten current callers actually do: they pass `message`, having already run
// `errorMessage(err, t)` themselves. That is not the mistake above — it is the correct
// second branch. Every one of them either folds an action error in ahead of the read's
// (`actionError ?? …`) or gates on `data` first, and several also pass a translated
// `title`, so they hold a translator regardless and composing the string is the simpler
// call. `error` is here for the caller that has nothing but the thrown failure; it is not
// the path the console happens to take today.

// type error at the call site instead of a prop that silently does nothing.
