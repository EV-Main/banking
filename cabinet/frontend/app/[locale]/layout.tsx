// whatever language it was authored in is the language every reader would get.
//
// The locale comes from this route's own `params` rather than `currentLocale()`. Metadata
// generation is not inside the render that `next/root-params` reads from — this function
// runs *for* the root layout, not within it — and `params` is right here in the signature
// anyway. A segment that is not one of the five falls back to English rather than throwing:
// the 404 for that is the layout's to raise, a few lines down, where there is a page to
// show for it.
